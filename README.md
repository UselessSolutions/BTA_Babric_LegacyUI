A UI overhaul mod for BTA, designed with controllers in mind!
Brings back that legacy console feel with its own style!

Thanks to PedroThePanda64 for creating the Better than Legacy Logo!

# About

Better Than Legacy is a GUI overhaul mod which redesigns the GUIs in BTA to look, act, and feel much more like the GUIs found on the Legacy Console Editions of Minecraft.
With controller support!

Better Than Legacy is also a fully clientside mod, all features work in multiplayer without the server needing the mod installed.

### Current GUIs include:
- Creative Mode GUI ![BTLegacy Creative Mode GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/01913028b978c6dad2940e87902261555fdcb8c7.png)
